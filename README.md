# Fonts-GFS-Majuscule

GFS was founded in 1992 by the late Michael S. Macrakis (1925–2001) as a 
Non-Profit Organization with the expressed aim of contributing to the 
research of Greek typography. The Society was founded initially by the 
Kostopoulos Foundation, with further support provided by 
the Greek Ministry of Culture, the Leventis Foundation, 
Regis College-USA, the Maliotis Foundation and the Girondelis Foundation. 
Furthermore, the Greek Literary and Historical Archives (ELIA) offered valuable
support by providing office space for the first four years of GFS’s operation. 

GFS was founded with the express aim to research the history of 
Greek typography and the design of historic and contemporary Greek typefaces, 
which shall bridge the gap between metal and digital technology.
GFS has released all its digital fonts free for every application
and supports each one with polytonic typesetting capability for
use by the various Centres of Hellenic Studies worldwide.

All the majuscule fonts available here were designed by
George D. Matthiopoulos and are samples of the various trends 
used in Greek typography: GFS Ambrosia has the main characteristics 
of the majuscule forms of the early Christian tradition while 
GFS Nicefore is a typical byzantine sample of the 5th-7th century period. 
GFS Jackson is an edition of the font cut, in 1788, by Joseph Jackson on 
commission by the Cambridge University in preparation of the edition of 
the Beza codex containing the New Testament from the 5th-6th century.
Theodore Beza was the erudite scholar from Geneva who had given the 
codex as a gift to the University in 1581. GFS Eustace is a typical example 
of byzantine woodcut initials used in many similar forms in Italy for 
Greek editions of the Bible, Prayers and other theological literature 
from the 15th to 19th centuries. GFS Fleischman, on the contrary, was cut
by Johann Michael Fleishman, typecutter of the Dutch Enschedé foundry 
and follows th baroque style of the mid-18th century aesthetics.
